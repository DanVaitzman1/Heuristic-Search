# Heuristic-Search

## Description
This repository contains Python code for solving the Pancake Flipping Puzzle using heuristic search algorithms. The problem involves flipping a stack of pancakes to sort them from smallest to largest, using only spatula flips. The code includes implementations of different heuristics, search algorithms, and search node classes.

## File Structure
- `heuristics.py`: Defines heuristic functions for estimating the cost of reaching the goal state.
- `pancake_state.py`: Implements the PancakeState class representing the state of the pancake stack.
- `search.py`: Contains functions for performing A* search to find the optimal solution.
- `search_node.py`: Defines the SearchNode class representing nodes in the search tree.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Use the provided classes and functions to solve pancake flipping puzzles.
4. Modify the `heuristics.py` file to experiment with different heuristic functions.
5. Run the `search.py` script to see the search algorithm in action.

## Awards
- **Best Project:** This project won the award for the best project in class, achieving the optimal solution with minimum time using heuristic search algorithms.
